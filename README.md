# OTIO to Reaper converter

This script is a quick'n dirty converter using [OpenTimelineIO](https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io) wonderfull project.

Very basic, it works but is limited:

- working:
  - export audio clips
- TODO:
  - implement Reaper -> OTIO
  - add markers
  - separate core logic from command line usage and make a [OTIO plugin](https://github.com/OpenTimelineIO/OpenTimelineIO-Plugins)
